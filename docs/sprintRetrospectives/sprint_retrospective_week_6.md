# Sprint Retrospective

## Iteration #4 week 6

| Task #           | Task Assigned To         | Estimated Effort per Task (in Hours) | Actual Effort per Task (in Hours) | Done (yes or no) | Notes     |
|:------------------------:| ------------------------:| -----------------------------------: | --------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------: | ---------: |
| Technical writing presentation | Everyone | 2 | 2 | yes | Slides and text preparation |
|#41 | Alex | 20 | 15  | yes | Added a new view StudentList where the lecturer can see all the students and TAs and HeadTAs in that course_edition and can allocate them new roles so instead of TA he can give someone HeadTA or remove it leaving them with student |
|#43 | Alex | 20 | 20 | yes | Added a new view called Assign To Groups where the lecturer can see all the TAs and HeadTAs within the course and can assign them to multiple groups from a dropdown menu |
| #13 | Melle | 20 | 20 | yes | This issue was relevant because rubrics were a very standalone part of the application before. After finishing this issue rubrics were introduced in the week view next to attendance, and the teacher view was placed in the sidebar. Using middleware the views were limited to only those who should be allowed to access the functionality as defined in the requirements. |
| #44 | Melle | 16 | 16 | yes | This feature was implemented alongside the notes which will provide a problem signal. Any note with a problem signal greater or equal to 1 will be displayed in a list inside the group and a notification is placed for that group inside the screen containing all groups. |
| #36 | Toma | 24 | 24 | yes | Finished implementing notes, per group and also individual, integrated with weeks and groups. |
| #30 | Toma | 8 | 8 | yes | Improved frontend of attendance to be consistent with notes and fixed small bugs. |
| #17 | Alexandru and Luca | 35 | 40 | yes ( but may require updating) | We added roles to views such that the user receives the required access with the credentials he logs in with. Weâ€™ve also added tests to the GUI implementation and fixed remaining bugs. |
