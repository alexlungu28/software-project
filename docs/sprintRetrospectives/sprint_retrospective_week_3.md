# Sprint Retrospective

## Iteration #1 week 3

| Task #           | Task Assigned To         | Estimated Effort per Task (in Hours) | Actual Effort per Task (in Hours) | Done (yes or no) | Notes     |
|:------------------------:| ------------------------:| -----------------------------------: | --------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------: | ---------: |
| 1 | Whole team | 0.4 | 0.25 | yes | Definition of done available on GitLab |
| #15 (#26, #27) | Melle, Alex | 15 | 30 | no/partially | The tasks are not done yet because we have to merge the branch with the others to have the users and roles. After roles are setup for users we can implement the functionality to work only for them |
| #14  | Toma | 8 | 10 | partially | We decided we need SSO asap, so we gave up on integrating the dummy login in the app. The task was more complicated than projected, since new versions of Laravel use a more complicated approach for authentication. |
| #16 | Luca | 10 | 30 without testing | partially | The database schema had major overhauls throughout the week and the code had to be updated each time. Testing is the only thing left to be done. |
| #28 | Alexandru | 10 | 15 | partially | Due to the database changes throughout the week, the migrations had to be changed a few times. What is left to do for this issue is to add relations in the models. |
| #29 | Alexandru | 15 | 25 | partially | This task is taking longer than expected as we need to configure the saml plugin properly and the client will help us with the implementation. |

###Problems Encountered
- Problem 1\
description:We do not know yet how to change a specific view based on user input within the same view. \
reaction: We will ask Sander about it and make some more research which will probably lead us to javascript

- Problem 2\
description: A lot of missing dependencies in order to import students\
reaction:  We had to research on how to add these and it took some time since the answers online were from different php versions.
  
- Problem 3\
description: Tomaâ€™s laptop broke on Thursday of this week, so he could not do anything for 2 working days.\
reaction: In the meantime, the laptop is fixed and the missed work will be done this week.
