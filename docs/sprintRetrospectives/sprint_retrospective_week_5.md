## Iteration #3 week 5

| Task #           | Task Assigned To         | Estimated Effort per Task (in Hours) | Actual Effort per Task (in Hours) | Done (yes or no) | Notes     |
|:------------------------:| ------------------------:| -----------------------------------: | --------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------: | ---------: |
| #29 | Alexandru | 7 | 10 | yes | The users are now correctly added to the database. Now authentication works properly and we can work on the other issues that involve user affiliation. |
|#26 | Alex | 30 | 30  | yes| Added CRUD operations to a nice view of all the rubrics and a table like view where the lecturer can select which row or column to delete.  |
| #26 | Melle | 24 | 30 | yes | Creating unit tests for repository functions was something we had yet to do thoroughly, it was expected for this to take quite some time. |
| Remove vendor from repository | Melle | 4 | 2 | yes | Vendor was taking up storage in our repository, we found out that it was added due to a miscommunication and therefore could be removed. |
| Create midterm presentation | All | 20 (collectively) | 20 | yes | |
| #30 | Toma | 24 | 24 | yes | Integrated attendance with groups/weeks, and modified it according to the client’s wishes, including ‘late’ option. |
|#17 |Luca and Alexandru | 20 | 30 | partially | We added the Employee, Student and Lecturer/HeadTa views with a hierarchy of Courses->Course Editions->Groups, where groups still have to be implemented. |
