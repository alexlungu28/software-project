|#46 | Luca | 20 | 20 | yes | lecturers are now able to import TAs |
|#47 | Alexandru | 15 | 32 | yes | Initially, this issue was supposed to only add separate views for TAs, but features such as back buttons, reversing soft deletes, updating the GUI to contain all the CRUD operations on one page and changing the color scheme were all implemented on the branch of this issue. This is why it took much longer than expected.
