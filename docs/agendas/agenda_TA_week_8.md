# Question round
- If you look at the assignments tab in brightspace, there is currently in the final report a wordcount for each section.
The total words should be 15000, but adding up all of the minimal word counts per section it is not close to the minimum of the complete report.
  - If you stay in the middle of these limits it should add up to at least 15000 words.
