# Questions for the TA
- How often are we expected to work on the final report?
    - Ideally, every week we should document what we did as to make sure we do not grind the report in the final weeks and risk running out of time.
      
- What is your feedback for the midterm presentation?
    - Quality of documentation - We lack a short description of what functions do.
    - Design quality 
        - We need to justify our choices, the reason behind chosen technologies is lacking.
        - Using something because the client said so is not enough of a reason, in our case the client is a teacher but he can be uninformed, need to support these choices as well.
    - Work distribution - Balance commits so that everyone has around the same amount.
    - Planning - Not such a problem, fix the other issues first.
    - Address the rubric without pointing to it explicitly in the presentation.
    - Overall, the presentation was good content wise.

- What should next week's presentation for Technical Writing be about?
    - The presentation should be based mainly on the report, not on the product itself.

# Question round
*If there are any spontaneous questions.*

# Closing
Next week's meeting will be on Monday 31st at 14:30
