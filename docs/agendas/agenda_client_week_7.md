# Questions for the Client

- How can we link pcov (https://github.com/krakjoe/pcov) to the pipeline on gitlab?
- Currently, for the user exports, all users in the database are exported. Should we make them for specific course editions or are they not needed at all?
- When a lecturer imports a TA in a course edition, he won't see that course edition when he logs in until the lecturer assigns him to a group. Is that fine, or should he be able to see the course edition while not belonging to any group?


# Question round
*If there are any spontaneous questions.*
