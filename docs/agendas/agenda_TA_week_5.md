# Questions for the TA

- From the midterm rubric we've gathered that the presentation should cover the product and the process. 
  How should we touch on these subjects? Show our progress in a short demo, cover our requirements and prioritization in a powerpoint presentation?
    - The midterm presentation is basically a simulation of the final presentation. Explain the problem, how are we solving it and why.
- How long should the presentation take?
    - The presentation should be at least 10 minutes, and up to around 20 minutes. 

- Should we revise our communication with the coach? It is currently tedious to write an email and have to wait several days before we get a reply.
    - Ask the coach if he agrees on changing the communication way.
- How should we go about our planning regarding the TW presentations in combination with the main project, as preparing a presentation can take multiple days worth of time?
    - Technical writing is an important part of the course, so it is normal it takes time.

    - Alves' booked timeslots: Monday 24th 13.00, 14.00, and Tuesday 25th 14.00
    - Alves will look over the code after the midterm presentation, so refine before if needed.
