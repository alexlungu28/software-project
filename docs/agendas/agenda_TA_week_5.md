# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized.*

# Questions for the TA

- From the midterm rubric we've gathered that the presentation should cover the product and the process. 
  How should we touch on these subjects? Show our progress in a short demo, cover our requirements and prioritization in a powerpoint presentation?
- How long should the presentation take?
- Should we revise our communication with the coach? It is currently tedious to write an email and have to wait several days before we get a reply.
- How should we go about our planning regarding the TW presentations in combination with the main project, as preparing a presentation can take multiple days worth of time?

# Question round
*If there are any spontaneous questions.*

# Closing
*For any final remarks*
