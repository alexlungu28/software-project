# Action points for this week

- Technical Writing
- Different files to export
- Notifications
- Gitinspector implementation
- Group interventions

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized.*

# Questions for the Client

- We have added an employee list where the main lecturer of that course can assign other employees to be lecturers to that course. They can also be assigned as Head TA's. Should we remove that and leave them only to be lecturers?
- We are not using this image: lorisleiva/laravel-docker:8.0 instead of the mare-ci and pcov instead of xdebug, is there another way to configure the pipeline for our usage?
- How should the gitinspector and buddycheck be displayed in your 'vision' (like a table or any way to view it)?
- How many exports should there be? For example, grades from the application in a format recognizable by Brightspace, interventions, notes, attendance.
- How should interventions be solved? (solved if fulfilled, penalty if not?)

# Question round
*If there are any spontaneous questions.*

# Closing

Next meeting will be held on ... at ....
