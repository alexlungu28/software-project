# Approval of the agenda

The main points that need to be discussed are present in this week's agenda.

# Points of action

- Our current implementation of the gitlab pipeline.
- Some small specifics that have to be cleared up (see questions).

# Action points for this week

- Creation/editing and filling in rubrics.
- Dummy login system.
- Importing a list of students to add groups to a course.

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized.*

# Questions for the TA/Client

- Are rubrics simple n x m matrices? Or can a single rubric contain multiple matrices of different sizes?
- Does SSO have information about roles (ta, teacher) so that we know which type of user is trying to access the application.
- Should student numbers be stored as encrypted values, as they are linked to potentially sensitive data.

# Question round
*If there are any spontaneous questions.*

# Closing
