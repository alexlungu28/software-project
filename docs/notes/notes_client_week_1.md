#Questions & Answers:
- PHP, should we use it?
    - Java/PHP any language is fine (no hard constraints).

- TA's, teachers, specific people we can interview in the coming weeks to get to understand more about the problem and logistics.
    - Yoshi, Merel, TA's from OOPP/SEM, Sebastian Proksch and Annibale Panichella, Mitchell Olsthorn.

- Rubrics for OOPP or SEM (html, excel, markdown)
    - Not easily importable
    - We can get them after the interview
    
- Starting the project
    - We can get a premade pipeline from another project or start from scratch
    
- Spring security was normally used
    - SSO security, Sander could help us. Our system redirects to the SSO sign in page, after authentication SSO redirects back to our application with an OK
    
- Database?
  Test database locally on your own machine. Postgres is solid and used commonly. Anything is ok as long as we give arguments why we picked it.
  
- This week, get a list of requirements. And reiterate them with Sander.
  - High level planning, milestones, demo with certain features. (mock with ninja mock maybe or lucid chart)

- Send the requirements list on april 26th or 27th.
  - Information gaining, set some specific
  
- Issues with OOPP
  - Lots of videos, notes in a repository
  - List of features, did students do it yes no
  - Document to be graded, Insufficient Good Excellent
  - Grade process, statistics notes from TAs, stored in another file
  - Repositories with notes, Repositories with forms from gitinspector
  - Combining all of these different aspects into one view.
  - A group with one person being behind but it got lost in all the information.
  - As a lecturer see groups with problems
  - TAs should be able to log problems
  - If a student falls behind they should be able to save agreements with them (do something in the coming x days).
  - Could be different people grading (what features have been built, how good is the report).
  - Automatic linking is difficult because it's by a different company. Buddycheck turns into a CSV to be imported into the application.
  - If a specific student stands out in buddycheck, have a notification.
  - Rubrics, git statistics, buddycheck, TA notes (free text input).
  - Grading between projects differs, how exactly?
  - The approach is different, for SEM there is one person doing all the merging in the end. In OOPP there are multiple persons doing that together.
  - The contents of the rubrics are different.
  - List of feedback forms, expected input from TAs by the course's teachers, for TA's to easily find out what they are expected to input in these days.
  - As a lecturer, he gets confidential data, preferable to be able to store these in the system, but not visible to plain TA's. Have a way to authorize others to view this data.
  - Tedious to add students to the app, through brightspace he can generate a file containing students in groups, TA's would be linked to those groups.
  - If the app could generate the input to brightspace grading that would be excellent.
  - For consistency to other tools, using bootstrap would be nice.
  - 9:30 wednesday 28th of april, meet up with Sander to go over requirements list.
  - Take notes of meetings and share those with the participants.
