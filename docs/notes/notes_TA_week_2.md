- TA: Is grading not just divided over TAs based on the groups they manage?
    - with project courses project deadlines coincide with exam week
    - next quarter/semester break
    - usually each ta grades their own groups / some things may happen so other tas must be assigned to grade
    - TA's might need to share grading workload but that is in specific cases.
- Might be a could have -> Allow one to many relationship for groups to TAs.

- TAs decide with their own discretions problematic students / our approach will be the same but less direct

- we can use scene builder for the demo in a basic html static version of the site, other options include drawing by hand/in sketchbook/mspaint.

- by default pipeline gives a template on which we can build upon (Azure repositories have a different pipeline)

- send project plan to our coach(so that he can approve it)
- send requirements to sander
